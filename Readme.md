# README

As the original author soulwhip discontinued this addon and we simply loved it, we decided to bring it back. There is still a lot of work to be done (you may take a look at the current todo list below)

## We need you!

You can help us with localizations by going the [Localization page](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/rotation-builder/localization).

Be careful when translating phrases from the overview interface : rotations localizations are too big to be shown properly in it. You will have to edit them individually.

## What is Rotation Builder?

Rotation Builder allows you to build rotations dynamically without having to understand the Lua script language. The built rotation then displays the current action and the next action on your screen to tell you what to push next. Actions can be heavily customized with the General, Player, Target, Pet, and Focus tabs. The priority of actions can also be changed dynamically just by clicking the up and down arrows next to the action name in the Action list.
